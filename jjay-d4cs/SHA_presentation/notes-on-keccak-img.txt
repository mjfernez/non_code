Input is padded by padding function
This is split into chunks of r bits
Each of these is fed into the sponge function
In the "absorbing phase" bits are XORed with the first 1088 bits of 1600 bits of zeros and scrambled by the f function for 24 rounds
The result is "squeezed out" by taking out the first r bits of the absorbing phase output and further truncated to 256 bits
